# Description
Gator-Slack : In this project I have desinged a real-time support system for gators. The application will be useful for having conversations regarding a particular topic specified in Channels. Each user can set their names and Enter into channel and converse as much they want. This application provides the support needed at the moment and can be used as tool for passing information very easily.

The project is implemented using the tech-stack of React, GOlang and RethinkDB. For frontend, React is being used for the fact it is simple enough and the features in Virtual -DOM. The choice of GO for the backend is obvious owing to its concurrency. RethinkDB has been in the charts for real-time features and thus it is used in the project as it is suite for the theme.
